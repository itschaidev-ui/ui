# 3D model for hero background

Place your **Blender-exported GLB** here and name it:

- **`scene.glb`**

The hero will use:
- **Camera** from the file (first camera in the scene)
- **Lighting** from the file (all lights in the scene)
- **Meshes** as-is

Export from Blender: **File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb)** and enable **Include: Cameras** (and **Include: Selected Objects** / your scene).
