# ROADMAP

- **Current focus:** Agent brain (SOUL, RULES, STRATEGY, CONTEXT, TASK, STATE, LOG) and dashboard chat/code flow.
- **Next:** Pack-aware generation (UI packs and component packs in context); inventory and “import in chat” for active pack.
- **Later:** Persistent LOG or MEMORY summarization; optional UI for viewing agent state and docs.
